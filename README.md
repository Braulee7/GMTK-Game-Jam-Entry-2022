# GMTK-Game-Jam-Entry-2022
My entry for GMTK's annual game jam 2022 - "Chance Dungeon"

This year's jam revolved around the theme of "Roll of the Dice" so I designed and created a game within Unity's 
game engine to follow this theme. Chance Dungeon is a 2D platformer game all revolving around a pair of dice, 
these die decide the path you go through, which enemies you face, the enemy's damage and quantity, as well as
can help you further your chances of going through the dungeon. This game has no set end point and revolves
mainly through a point system, incentivising the player to kill the enemies and further progress through
the dungeon. 

The game is not a full release build and still in very early stages of development, but still fully playable and
enjoyable on itch.io's website at https://braulee.itch.io/chance-dungeon-gmtk.
